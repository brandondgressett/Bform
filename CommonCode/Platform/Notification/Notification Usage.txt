Purpose

The notification service is able to send notifications via email, text, and voice calls through 
Twilio and SendGrid APIs. It can also store user toast messages and notify web components to 
tell the user about the toasts.

A notification may include notification text for any or all of the four channels. 
A notification is targeted to a notification contact, group of notification contacts, 
or a list of notification contact groups.

Each notification defines a severity level that indicates the importance of the notification, as
well as specifications to suppress duplicates or consolidate notifications into a digest at
the sender's request. 

All notifications and notification digests are recorded into a notification audit repository,
which may be queried by user to present past notifications sent to a user.

Notification contacts describe contact details for each channel as well as rules for how to
handle notifications. The rules divide the day into three shifts: morning, day, and evening. 
Depending on notification severity and the shift of the day for the notification contact,
the rules define, for each channel, whether to allow, suppress, or consolidate notification messages.


Requesting Notifications

A notification contact is required to send notifications, and the NotificationRepository implements
the means to define them. The NotificationGroupRepository implements means to define groups of 
notification contacts that may also be used as targets for notifications.

The RequestNotification component can send notifications to the notification service for processing.
It will require a NotificationMessage to specify the work to be done. A notification message requires 
a subject even if the email channel isn't used. The subject is used to 
decide which messages should be suppressed or consolidated. Notification messages can 
define its target as notification groups, a notification group, or a single notification contact. 

Each processed notification can be retrieved from the NotificationAudit Repository, including
digests.



Dependency Injection

Dependent Services

Notification depends on all of the dependency injection for the 
Digest Consolidation and Duplicate Suppression services, as 
described in their usage files.
