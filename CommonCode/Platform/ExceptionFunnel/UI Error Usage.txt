Purpose:

UIError translates programese exceptions into readable messages. When an exception is thrown UIError sorts the exception into a Funnel. Each funnel is
registed to an exception by keywords provided to the funnel when the exception is registed. To register a new funnel call UIExceptionFunnel.Register().
When an exception is funneled UIExceptionFunnel provides details on the exception what file it was thrown from ,what line number, when it was thrown, and the stack
trace of the exception.

Usage:

Usage in UI (Eg, web controllers)
Register new exceptions using UIExceptionFunnel.Register().
UIExcetionFunnelRegistery Provides only one useful function CreateCombinedFunnel which takes a list of funnels to combine.


Extending Additional Exceptions
To register a new Exception with the Funnels a new instance of UIErrorTemplate must be made
for the new exception UIErrorTemplate contains: 
	(End-User-Friendly Message, ExceptionType, Keywords(Key words/phrases found commonly in the exception), RequiresAll(if all of the keywords are required))

When capturing an exception call UIExceptionFunnel.Funnel(), or call FunnelAlert() to record how many exceptions
of the same type have come in, and if should you raise the severity base on that.
